# scripts

This directory contains scripts that are on paperspace instances. Copied here
for reference:

When you get "inaccessible" on a machine in paperspace, running this script
can sometimes fix the issue:
```
wget -q -O - 'https://assets.paperspace.io/tools/install-notify-scripts.sh' | sudo /bin/sh
```
